The planning process of this program.

At first I wasn't really sure how to apprach how to track my gameboard.
After watching a few videos on youtube, I was able to put together the concept
of tieing in the click to the events needed. But where the functions need to take
place became a problem for me as I was trying to put my function that checks for a
winner, in my click function. After opening up an issue and getting it resolved
i was able to find where it needed to be.


Unsolved mysteries of the program were
-I wasn't able to get what I wanted done in time, So I would like to add the features
that I have in my user stories. Not really unsolved, just not done.
